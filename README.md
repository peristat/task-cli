# ðŸ§¾Task Properties

Each task have the following properties:

- `Id`: A unique identifier for the task
- `Description`: A short description of the task
- `Status`: The status of the task (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`)
- `CreatedAt`: The date and time when the task was created
- `UpdatedAt`: The date and time when the task was last updated

  Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`storage.json`) like this:
  ```json
  {
    "next_id": 12,
    "task": [
        {
            "CreateAt": "Mon May 19 23:37:41 2025\n",
            "Description": "Prepare for the maths test",
            "Id": 9,
            "Status": "In Progress",
            "UpdatedAt": "Mon May 19 23:38:19 2025\n"
        },
        {
            "CreateAt": "Mon May 19 23:39:45 2025\n",
            "Description": "SLEEP",
            "Id": 10,
            "Status": "To Do",
            "UpdatedAt": "Mon May 19 23:39:45 2025\n"
        },
        {
            "CreateAt": "Mon May 19 23:40:31 2025\n",
            "Description": "Go for a walk",
            "Id": 11,
            "Status": "Done",
            "UpdatedAt": "Mon May 19 23:40:52 2025\n"
        }
    ]
}

```
